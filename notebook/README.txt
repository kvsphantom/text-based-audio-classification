You can run these notebooks using the Jupyter notebooks installation of the Docker image provided in https://github.com/MTG/MIRCourse. Just copy this folder to the root folder of MIRCourse repository and run the Docker image.

Alternatively you can do a manual installation of the required python packages and run the notebooks without the docker image. The requirements are jupyter numpy sklearn matplotlib, which you can install by running:
pip install jupyter numpy sklearn matplotlib

Notebooks should run both in Python 2 and 3.

To visualize the "trees" in nice images (notebook B), you'll need to install Graphviz's 'dot' command line tool (https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/). This is not included in the Docker image therefore if you want to print the trees in images youâ€™ll have to go for the manual installation option. Alternatively trees can be print as raw text and this will work in both versions.
